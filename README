Net::AIM v0.01 README Thu Jul 29 19:49:00 EDT 1999

Description:
	This module is an implementation of the AOL Instant Messenger TOC 
protocol.  This is the first release meaning it won't contain EVERYTHING. 
It is based on Net::IRC so it has the exact same interface and event 
driven OO model.  I will be fixing the bugs and posting revisions soon.


Prerequisites:
	Net::AIM requires Perl version 5.004 or higher to install and run.
	Also IO::* is needed.

The latest version of Perl can be found at:
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz (for UNIX), or at
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/ for various non-Unix machines.


Installation:
	perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
	pray


	To make it run from this dir, just do the following:
		ln -s . Net
		./aimtest <sn> <pass>


Included Scripts:
	A test script (aimtest) is included which is similiar to the Net::IRC 
irctest script.  Ahhh who am I kidding it is practically irctest after 
"perl -pi -e's/irc/aim/g'". Just run ./aimtest provided perl is located in 
/usr/bin

	Usage: ./aimtest <screenname> <password>
